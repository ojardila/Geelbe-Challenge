# Geelbe Challenge

Challenge - Backend Developer
Write a program that prints all the numbers from 1 to 100. However, for
multiples of 3, instead of the number, print "Geelbe". For multiples of 5 print
"IT". For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "Geelbianos".

But here's the catch: you can use only one `if`. No multiple branches, ternary
operators or `else`.

# Requirements

- Maximum of 1 if
- You can't use `else`, `else if` or ternary
- Unit tests
- Apply your SOLID knowledge
- You can write the challenge in any language you want. Here at Geelbe we are
  big fans of PHP and Javascript
